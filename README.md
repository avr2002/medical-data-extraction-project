# medical-data-extraction-project

This is a basic python project using **OpenCV**, **FastAPI**, and **Regex** that extracts required data from medical documents like patient details and prescription details. This project uses **FastAPI** server in the backend which uses **very basic computer vision** and extracts medical information from pdfs using **pytesseract**. As of now I've developed any fronted but it was successfully tested using **Postman**.


All the project related code and files are in the backend folder

Run `main.py`
